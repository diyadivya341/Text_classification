ðŸ“Œ Full Project Summary:
Domain: Natural Language Processing (NLP) | Techniques: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Description:

Built a fake news detection model to classify news articles as real or fake based on textual content.

Performed data cleaning, text preprocessing (removal of stopwords, stemming, lemmatization), and feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

Trained and compared Logistic Regression and SVM models to identify the best-performing classifier.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Deployed the best model to predict the authenticity of unseen news articles.

- Key Skills: Text Preprocessing, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, SVM, Model Evaluation, NLP
